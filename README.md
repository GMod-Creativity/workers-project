## Questions and Answers (FAQs)

- **What is this project?**  
  The Worker Project is an E2 that can make buildings which generate resources. These resources can then be used to produce additional buildings.

- **What buildings can it make?**  
  The worker can build:
  - **Factories:** generate resources (more on that later)  
  - **Barracks:** spawn warriors  
  - **Towers:** shoot at incoming enemies with E2 bullets

- **What are resources?**  
  Resources represent the amount of money you have. You start with 500 when spawning the E2.  
  - Factories cost 200  
  - Barracks cost 350  
  - Towers cost 300

- **How does it work?**  
  The contraption is divided into three chips:  
  1. Controls the hologram of the Worker, which you move and use to build things  
  2. Provides a user interface to control the worker and give him orders  
  3. Contains the worker's coding and resource counter

- **Can I spawn more than one at a time, like make wars?**  
  Not yet, but this will be possible in future, more fully developed versions.

- **I don't want to have to get resources. Is there a version that doesn't require them?**  
  Yes, a version without resource requirements will be available.

- **When will this be available?**  
  We currently need a sponsor to help with coding. If you want to be a sponsor, contact me via Steam or the forums.

- **How did you come up with this idea?**  
  I was inspired by *Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth 2* and its expansion pack.

- **Who is developing this?**  
  Myself, anyone who wishes to contribute, and a friend of mine, Captain Bonkers II, who initially got the idea.

- **Originally Posted by Yevano:**  
  *"This looks cool. Is this supposed to be a game, or a self-sustaining civilization? I could help with coding some of this if you'd like."*  
  **Answer:** Both.
